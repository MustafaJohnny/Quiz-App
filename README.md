# Quiz App - Frontend Practical Project

## Overview

Fast and useful application. This is the first project that I wrote on my own and it helped me to build a strong foundation in JavaScript and also to understand the basic fundamentals of planning and creating a project. In this project users will be given one question for which they will have four options to choose from. Based on the user choice, the score will be incremented by one. The next question appears automatically upon selecting an option and then submitting it. When the quiz is finished, the result will be processed and shown on the UI.
